        <img class="hr-card"  src="camp_layout.png" alt="a map of the camps layout" style="width:592px; display: block; margin: auto">
    <h2> The camp is the heart of Fallen Claws, where young and old, vetted and new mingle.</h2>
        <p>★ To enter Fallen Claws' camp, you must enter a hole in the bottom of a large wooden door. There, you will access Fallen Claws' camp, a small yard surrounded by ruined buildings. Most of Fallen Claws' is accessible from this yard.</p>
        <p>★ Camp itself is not very well sheltered, but enclosed and private. Like the rest of Fallen Claws' territory, it is overrun by weeds and overgrown vegetation.</p>
        <p>★ The Fresh Kill Pile is located in the camp on some flattened cardboard. Opposite the Sanctuary is the quietest corner of camp where some have decided to set up their dens and nests as opposed to sleeping in the abandoned building.</p>

        <img class="hr-card" src="fireescape.png" alt="an image of a rusted fire escape staircase" style="width:592px; display: block; margin: auto">
    <h2> The leaders throne and stage. Announcments take place at the top, and secrets are shared beyond. </h2>
    <p>★ Opposite the entrance to camp, stands a rusty Fire Escape staircase where Fallen Claws' Leader has carried out announcements and ceremonies since the group's creation.</p>
    <p>★ The staircase gives access to a two story building. This building only has two accessible rooms; the downstairs and the upper room connected to the staircase. Both rooms are small and cut off from the wider Fallen Claws, presumably due to a barricade of fallen furniture. Both rooms are used as shelter for the Leader.</p>
    <p>★ It is dependent on the Leader's preferences as to which room they occupy. The other room may be given to family and friends.</p>

    <h1> The Sanctuary</h1>
    <p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/961441096506957904/961441098989981709">The Sanctuary Channel</a></p>
        <img class="hr-card" src="thesactuary.png" alt="an over grown building" style="width:592px; display: block; margin: auto">
    <h2> The smell of herbs and the whispers of the sick linger. Do the stars guide the residents here?</h2>
    <p>★ The Sanctuary is a small building situated beside camp's entrance. It is accessible through an open doorway and does not have a floor above it.</p>
    <p>★ The Sanctuary's most defining feature is it's curved wall and several large windows. They give the inside of the building plenty of light. This allows a select few herbs to grow within the room, most of which are planted in boxes and pots of varying sizes. A small empty bookshelf provides a sturdy set of shelves for herbs to be kept on. The most dangerous herbs and poisons are hidden away in tins or jars on the upper shelves.</p>
    <p>★ Boxes and fabric line the Sanctuary's floor for the sick and injured to occupy. The healers themselves rest at the back of the Sanctuary beneath a table, with a long piece of fabric draped over the surface.</p>

    <h1> The Abandoned Building</h1>

    <h2>Sleepy purrs and soft conversation radiate from here. This, is home.</h2>
    <p>★ When entering Fallen Claws' camp, members are met with a large building to their left, which is accessible through an open doorway. Although there is no second floor, the building provides plenty of space and has become the place where the majority of Fallen Claws rest their heads.</p>
    <p>★ Nests of various types litter the building floor; some are made up of fabrics, while others are built up over empty crates or cardboard boxes. The type of nest a member builds is dependent on their personal preference.</p>
    <p>★ Cats group up togeather in their family groups and cliques, nesting by those they care most about. When it becomes to cold or wet to carry conversation in the camp, the conversation moves within these protective walls. </p>

    <h1> The Warehouse Ruins</h1>
    <p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/961441096506957904/961441098989981711">The Warehouse Ruins Channel</a></p>
        <img class="hr-card" src="theruins.png" alt="a pile of rubble that was once a warehouse" style="width:592px; display: block; margin: auto">
    <h2> Shelted among the toppled knots of metal and stone, Fallen Claws trains to become stronger.</h2>
    <p>★ Once Fallen Claws' training arena, this is all that remains of the largest warehouse on Fallen Claws' territory. After a gas explosion, the building is now nothing but rubble and debris. The wreckage is difficult to navigate, a graveyard full of household materials charred from the subsequent fire.</p>
    <p>★ Despite its morbid past, the ruins are still used as training grounds for Fallen Claws. Mountains of debris are useful for those wanting to better their agility, while moving heavy rubble can be useful for those wanting to be physically strong.</p>
    <p>★The ruins serve as a reminder that despite their stuggles, Fallen Claws must adapt and overcome to ensure their survival.</p>

    <h1> Fallen Claws Territory</h1>
    <p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/961441096506957904/961441098989981712"> Fallen Claws Inner Territory</a> And <a href="https://discord.com/channels/961441096506957904/961441098809606192">Fallen Claws Outer Territory</a> </p>
        <img class="hr-card" src="territory.png" alt="an overgrown city abandoned by humans" style="width:592px; display: block; margin: auto">
    <h2> A maze of corners and dead ends to everyone but its residents.</h2>
    <p>★ Fallen Claws' territory is in the heart of a small, desolate industrial estate, the buildings are derelict and abandoned. Due to the changing times, factories and buildings were left in ruin, unable to keep up with the advancement in technology. Over the years these buildings have been untouched by human presence, leaving nature to take over the city once more.</p>
    <p>★ Whilst some buildings are inaccessible, some can still be explored by Fallen Claws members in search of trinkets, fabrics and prey.</p>
    <p>★ While the land is uninhabited by humans and nature is slowly reclaiming the stone and rust, humans still rarley make an apperance and disrupt life. </p>

    <h1> The Sewers</h1>
    <p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/961441096506957904/961441098989981713">The Sewers Channel</a></p>
        <img class="hr-card" src="thesewers.png" alt="underground tunnels that once channeled wastewater" style="width:592px; display: block; margin: auto">
    <h2> A maze of foul smelling tunnels inhabited by disease ridden rats. Perfect for the prisoners.</h2>
    <p>★  Below Fallen Claws' territory lies a series of interconnecting sewer systems. These systems are long since abandoned, no longer in use, and left neglected by humans.</p>
    <p>★  Over the years, cats have drowned in the thick sewer water, thus members are warned to take care and precaution when travelling down into the sewers. Rats are also a large problem down in the sewers, where rodents are large and violent. Despite the damp, dangerous conditions, some do persist, deciding to brave the sewer system in hopes of finding prey.</p>
    <p>★  From time to time, the sewers are also used to house prisoners. Large cracks in the walls, large enough for crates make the perfect place for feline prisoners. These prisoners are always guarded by Fallen Claws warriors.</p>

    <h1> Bloodclan Border</h1>

        <img class="hr-card" src="bcborder.png" alt="the border of bloodclan and Fallen Claws" style="width:592px; display: block; margin: auto">
    <h2> A lane of quiet distrust. </h2>
    <p>★  A barred fence stands between BloodClan and Fallen Claws. Fallen Claws faces BloodClan’s graveyard. Bloodclan faces some derelict buildings and once-bustling warehouses of Fallen Claws’ territory.</p>
</div>

<div class="container-tr">
    <h1> The Bog</h1>
    <p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/961441096506957904/1069383820920492073">The Bog Channel</a></p>
        <img class="hr-card" src="thebog.png" alt="marshy forest full of mud and standing water" style="width:592px; display: block; margin: auto">
    <h2> Wet mud, slimey leaves, and bountiful prey, if you know where to look.</h2>
    <p>★ The bog neighbors the city, and was claimed under Shiversight's reign. It is a marshy area, decorated with thick vegetation and low hanging trees.</p>
    <p>★ It provides prey, in the form of frogs, newts, toads and water voles. Herbs are also in abundance, thriving in the damp terrain.</p>
    <p>★ Despite the advantages, it is an exceptionally slippery place - especially in the Winter - thus felines must watch their step when travelling through it. With that said, some Fallen Claws members have made the terrain easier to traverse; placing wooden palettes, crates and planks to help them cross the marshy areas.</p>

    <h1> The Canal</h1>
    <p><a href="https://discord.com/channels/1292161634810462389/1335361273088446585/1335365142598123530">The Canal Channel</a></p>
        <img class="hr-card" src="thecanal.png" alt="an ancient water duct that still flows" style="width:592px; display: block; margin: auto">
    <h2> A vein of water, its pulse feeding an ecosystem of life.</h2>
    <p>★ The canal sits not too far away from the bog and was discovered under Shiversight's reign. It is a body of water with a concrete walkway either side. The area is notably easier to navigate compared to the bog.</p>
    <p>★ It provides prey, the form of frogs, newts, toads and water voles and most unusually; fish. Herbs are also in abundance, thriving in the damp terrain. The canal is one of the most scenic parts of Fallen Claws' territory, and draws hunters, herb collectors and lovers to the scenery.</p>
    <p>★ In the summer, the canal hosts a wide variety of wildlife thanks to the overgrown vegetation. It is a bustling hub for ecosystems, providing rich prey. In the winter, the canal remains a scenic route, however felines must be careful as the body of water freezes and drowning becomes a real danger.</p>
