   <h2>
    Often considered modest and kind, Soleil is a warm presence within Fallen Claws! He does what he can to help others, and almost always puts his group before himself. Though, he does have a tendency to break the rules at times.
   </h2>
   
    <h3> 
        Raised by multiple non-blood related group members, he is a cat with undying loyalty and admiration for his home and its residents. Despite his disadvantages because of his cerebellar hypoplasia (aka wobbly cat syndrome), he tries his best to support his loved ones through thick and thin. He's well known both within and outside of Fallen Claws as a cat embodied with sunlight, and while he's not very strong physically, his emotional resilience has been proven tome and time again.
